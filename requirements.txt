2.	Problem Statement

There is a prevalence and rising trend in poor mental health in Singaporeans, with almost 1 in 3 people between 15 and 35 years of age reporting “severe or extremely severe symptoms of depression, anxiety and/or stress.” Research on journaling has found that it can help manage mental health symptoms. But what if there was an app that can make journaling a little more interactive, help people figure out their emotions, and be a tool for mental health professionals to have a connection with their clients?
